# Login Command

The `login` and `logout` commands manage authentication with Skene Cloud upstream, which is required for pushing growth loops and telemetry via the `push` command.

## Prerequisites

- A Skene Cloud workspace URL (e.g. `https://skene.ai/workspace/my-app`)
- An API token for your workspace

## Basic usage

Log in to upstream:

```bash
uvx skene-growth login --upstream https://skene.ai/workspace/my-app
```

The command prompts you for a token, validates it against the upstream API, and saves the credentials.

Check login status:

```bash
uvx skene-growth login --status
```

Log out:

```bash
uvx skene-growth logout
```

## Flag reference

### `login`

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--upstream TEXT` | `-u` | Upstream workspace URL |
| `--status` | `-s` | Show current login status for this project |

### `logout`

No options. Removes saved credentials for the current project.

## How credentials are stored

Login saves two files:

| File | Contents | Security |
|------|----------|----------|
| `.skene-upstream` (project directory) | Upstream URL, workspace slug, timestamp | Non-secret, safe to commit |
| `~/.config/skene-growth/credentials` | Authentication token (keyed by workspace) | Restrictive permissions (`0600`), never commit |

Each project can target a different upstream workspace. The credentials file stores tokens keyed by workspace slug, so multiple projects can coexist.

## Token resolution

When commands need an upstream token, it is resolved in this order:

1. `SKENE_UPSTREAM_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Config file `api_key` field (if `.skene-upstream` exists)
3. `~/.config/skene-growth/credentials` file (keyed by workspace)

## Next steps

- [Push](push.md) -- Push growth loops and telemetry to upstream
- [Configuration](configuration.md) -- Config files, env vars, and priority
